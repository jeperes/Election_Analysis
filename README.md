# Challenge overview
After printing the "total Votes in the election", "each candidateâ€™s total votes and percentage of votes" and "the winner of the election, winning vote count, and winning percentage of votes", the auddit requested new analysis in the election data in order to get the Election Results Printed to the Command Line and The Election Results Saved to a Text File. 

Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays, perform mathematical operations, use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once, loops and variables were some of the tools used to perform the analysis.
